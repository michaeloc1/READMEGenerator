 ## Description
 This project simplifies making a professional README file for your project.  
 It was motivated by the need to create a README file without having to format the md file.  
 It lets the user spend less time having to create the README and spend more time coding  the project itself.  
 I learned about coding in node and also using the inquirer package.
